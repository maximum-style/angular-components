## Create new components
Run the following command to create a new component/directive: `npm run generate OPTION NAME`. 

For the `OPTION`, you can inform:
- `component`, or simply `c`, to generate a new component;
- `directive`, or simply `d`, to generate a new directive.

In either case, a showcase component will also be created.

Similarly, you can execute `npm run g OPTION NAME`, for a shorthand version.
